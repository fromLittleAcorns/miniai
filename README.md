The original miniai library is great but is tied to the course. We have
found it a very powerful and light framework that is easy to use,
understand and build upon, which is the purpose of this repository. In
particular it is easy to add write and add new callbacks that enhance
the capability of the framework. This repository in intended to organise
the framework is a more functional manner and to provide a home for
additional callbacks and other additions. More details will be added as
the content is developed
